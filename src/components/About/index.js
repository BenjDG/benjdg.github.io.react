            My name is Ben. As a recent graduate of the University of Kansas Full-Stack coding bootcamp, I have new skills in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js and responsive web design. Being a self-starter and intellectual, I also enjoy learning new skills and collaborating in teams to maintain and create web applications. A bachelorâ€™s degree in education and 5 years as a Systems Engineer give me a great foundation to build my skills upon. Working in education, healthcare and government give me inside background knowledge to create effective and user-first web applications. I enjoy writing code and employing new technologies to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of the product and business.
